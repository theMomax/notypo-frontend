# notypo-frontend

This is the frontend of the **notypo**-game. It is a client to the [REST/Websocket backend](https://github.com/theMomax/notypo-backend).

## Idea

The idea of the notypo-game is to provide a way to kids to learn typing, while having fun. The first functionality I'm aiming for is a basic typing speed test. Later on, I want to add a competitional multiplayer-mode, where only the fastest writer survives over time.

## Motivation

While I want the backend to be as solid and performant as software should be, the frontend is a little experiment on how far you can get with Go (compiled to WebAssembly) in the Browser. Therefore some dependencies are not even from a master-branch and rather experimental (go modules rock!).

## State

extreamly experimental
